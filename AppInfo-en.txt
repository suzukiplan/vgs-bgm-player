VGS BGM Player is a portable audio player that plays VGS format music data. This application imports VGS-format music data saved on Dropbox and allows you to listen to it while you are offline. 
Music data that is in VGS format is different from typical music data formats such as AAC, MP3, etc., in that it can play music from real-time waveform arithmetic. 
The size of the data for each song is extremely small in comparison to typical music data (sound sources in compressed formats) because of this.

(References)
- Typical music data: around 1MB for one minute.
- VGS Music Data: between about 1KB to 30KB for a song that is around 5 minutes long.
*1KB is 1/1024 of 1MB.

VGS music data that has been imported into this application can be played even when offline.
